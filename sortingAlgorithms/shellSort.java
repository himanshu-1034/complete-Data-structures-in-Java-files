// in shell sort, we choose the gap depending upon the formula ((three raised to the power k)-1)/2
// the initial gap we choose should be as much close to the length of array as possible but should not exceed its length
// for example , for array of length 15 we would choose the value of k as 3 so that initial gap becomes 13 which is less than 15(length of array)
// this is the basic consideration .... we can choose our own gap size but it should decrement in a linear way.
